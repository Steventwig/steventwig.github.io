          I am 29 years old and have been working in the IT industry for the past 13 years. I started in computer repair at the age of 16. Like most teenagers, I wanted to build my own computer; so I started out helping a friend who owned a web design and online educational center. He hired me for a summer job working on building, repairing, and installing computer software. </p>
        <p>It didn’t take long for me to realize that I had a particular knack and enjoyed learning about the multifaceted complexities of technology. What was a summer job, turned into a passion. I stayed working with my friend through the remainder of my teens and into my early 20’s; learning as much as I could from him. I was then hired on to a private company to run and administer their "technology" software and hardware department. This was the time to truly hone in on my skill set and by this point I wanted to dive further into this field. I envisioned where I could take the next step...</p>
        <p>I saw that in the private sector I was limited. I then went on to join the military as a Systems Administrator. After basic training I traveled to Biloxi, MS. to continue my tech school training where they taught me Back End Systems. In the military my scope and knowledge base expanded exponentially.  I am now working as the Assistant IT Department Lead for a government contract; while still serving in the AF Reserves.</p>
